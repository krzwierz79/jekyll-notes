I'm a translator (MA in linguistics), educator (BA in teaching), an enthusiast programmer (tons of bugs in Python and JS) and a lifetime geek (it all started in the 1980s from a borrowed ZX Spectrum+).

### More Information

Here I'm testing the waters with Jekyll, [there](https://krzysiekwie.github.io/hugonotes/) I'm using less English and more Polish, with Hugo (looks like I might be moving on to Hugo or Gatsby soon and abandon this site)
