I just got my certificate in
[Getting Started with AWS Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-machine-learning/home/welcome)

The course features an interesting collection of videos, covering Machine Learning in more detail than the Finnish AI course that everyone's been taking last year. Graded quizzes are trivial in comparison, and I was able to get 100% scores before watching the videos most of the time. One regret is not being offered more hands-on practice. The highlight was Week 4 (out of 5) with around 1hr of videos devoted to NLP.
