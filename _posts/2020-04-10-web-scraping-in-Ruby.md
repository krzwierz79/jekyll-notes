Trying Ruby first crossed my mind in mid 2000s when I first heard about it on one of TWiT podcasts, but only today I got around to it. And let me say, it is fast! Writing my [first ever Ruby script](https://github.com/krzysiekwie/ruby-quick-scrapper) (based on [two](https://www.distilled.net/nokogiri-and-ruby-web-scraping/) [tutorials](https://school.geekwall.in/p/Cczq7Lng/build-a-web-scraper-with-ruby-in-less-than-30-minutes)) took me less time than deciding whether I want to use rbenv or rvm to install Ruby on my Linux laptop.
