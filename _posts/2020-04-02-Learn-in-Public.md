I've always been a note-taking person but only recently got bombarded by ideas like [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) [here](https://dev.to/miku86/learn-in-public-4jl2) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgbEGFOtgqM) and while "building my audience while I build my skills" is a tad too out-there for my tastes, the quote from [this article on freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-python-and-computer-science-in-this/) stating that

“the worst way to learn to program is to learn alone.” (freeCodeCamp founder -- Quincy Larson)

really got to me. So here I am. Out there. On top of my GitHub planning to (slowly) migrate some of my notes from the likes of [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin) on the kind of problems life and MOOCs throw at you.
