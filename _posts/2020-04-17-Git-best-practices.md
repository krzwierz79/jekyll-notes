## Git Best practices for Collaboration

Always sync branches before starting new work

Make small commits for separate changes

Work on big changes on a separate branch

Merge master onto feature often to reduce conflicts

With two or more versions use master for latest and a separate branch for stable version

Do not rebase changes that were pushed to remote repos

Write informative commit messages

on merge conflict: disable all added content, test that source works, then re-add step by step
